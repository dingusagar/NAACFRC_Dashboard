# NAACFRC Dashboard


## Run the dashboard

From the project root (with the virtualenv active if you created one), run:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the dashboard server (check `app.py` for the listening port; commonly Flask apps use port 5000). Open your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or the configured host/port).
